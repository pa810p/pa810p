# Paweł Prokop
### passionate software engineer :v:

I live in a beautiful city Kraków, Poland.
I like to optimize and solve issues using various technologies and programming languages - mostly Java, Python and also C++ in the past. I'm also a linux fan and open-source enthusiast.

My motto is:
> Give me an issue, and I'll find a solution. :wave:
